# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
I made this to learn how to properly use 'canvas', but this is just very surface level. I might make the CSS better so it actually looks good, but what it has now is enough.
Contains two separate sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
I will not be adding anymore (despite my fondness for gnome sort...).
